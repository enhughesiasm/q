1) get this dodgy version running on live again
 - get a proper npm run liveserver command on q-server; make sure that starts robustly when Custard2020 reboots
 - (copy it from s.enhughesiasm.com)
 b) finish DNS propagation and get the page running at q.enhughesiasm.com
 c) update the enhughesiasm homepage to link to q.enhughesiasm.com again

2) rewrite front-end using modern react + typescript
   - redesign API as you go, and make the back end MUCH MUCH better, it's a mess right now. 
   - also have typescript + shared interface objects for the API to keep it all sane.
3) fix all the features, much better admin tools, actual authentication and permissions etc
